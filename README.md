# Mp3player
Python practice with Grandpa

This is a mp3 playback program for my Grandpa. The finished product will use a Raspberry Pi to playback audio files at the push of a button.

It will play numbered files from a directory, so changing out files is as simple as swapping a file with one that starts with the same number in the directory.
